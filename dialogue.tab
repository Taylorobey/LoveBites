BotchedEscapeScene_9d0ecd53		You're left with your own thoughts as Ashina departs upstairs. You begin to wander the cabin aimlessly.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	8	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_edd6df56		You realize the front door is open.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	15	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_767e0d56		Ashina should be asleep by now. This is your chance to escape and bring back help for Cameron.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	20	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_4cc7d7b2		It would be nice to get some fresh air. You've been stuck inside for a couple days now, and you can’t help feeling a bit claustrophobic.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	24	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_6d4ac355		You lean out of the open door as quietly as possible to find…	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	28	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_3a3b2b3c	you	…Nothing?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	38	you "[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_56ea0a48		You take a few cautious steps outside, thinking your eyes must be playing tricks on you. Where did all the dogs go? Was this another lucky break, like when Cameron snuck in?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	44	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_1beddbf1		You continue on, making it to the edge of the forest. You can hear your heart pounding in your chest. Were you really able to just… walk out of here?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	51	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_094eab8a		As you move into the foliage, you're stopped dead in your tracks. A silver arrow is aimed square between your eyes. The wielder of the bow is a sharp-eyed, hooded figure with hair black as night.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	61	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_e58d9d0f	aki	Don't you dare move, monster!	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	65	aki "[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_ca61e685		You put your hands up in the most placating gesture you can manage.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	67	"[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_35f4f675	you	Monster…? Uh, I think this is a misunderstanding, maybe we could just-	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	69	you "[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_f15f8a3f	aki	Stop. You will not fool me. I know you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	73	aki "[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_4a77b87b	aki	I will have no mercy on you. Your death shall be painful, I will make sure of it. You will suffer for every life you have stolen, and I will have my revenge. You chose the wrong night to leave your little fortress, and now, you will finally pay.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	77	aki "[what]"
BotchedEscapeScene_4dcbc288		You can't just let it end here. Not now.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	79	"[what]"
PleadCase_6779a625	you	No, wait, please! I never asked to be a monster!	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	93	you "[what]"
PleadCase_e73b4391		The hooded woman looks surprised at your outburst. Her stance doesn't waver, but she nods slowly at you to continue.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	97	"[what]"
PleadCase_5e2032ca	you	Where do I begin…? I was out late. A bunch of dogs, hundreds of them, cornered me into an alley. Then, a huge wolf-beast attacked me, dragged me here, and turned me into…	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	99	you "[what]"
PleadCase_2669df36	aki	The smaller dogs you mentioned. Where are they now?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	103	aki "[what]"
PleadCase_083af611		The woman lowers her bow, looking around suspiciously.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	111	"[what]"
PleadCase_33331969	you	I don’t know, they were gone when I stepped outside. They must have run off somewhere, maybe-	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	113	you "[what]"
PleadCase_54f61c73	aki	The large one, the wolf-beast. That is their master, is it not?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	119	aki "[what]"
PleadCase_6d58198f	you	Yes. She goes by Ashina. She's been holding me captive.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	121	you "[what]"
PleadCase_aaabf4b2	you	My friend tried to rescue me, but now they’re trapped here too. She said she wouldn’t do anything to them so long as I behave, but…	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	123	you "[what]"
PleadCase_d14af909	aki	I see. So that lycanthrope is going around toying with the lives of innocent humans yet again. What a disgusting creature.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	129	aki "[what]"
PleadCase_2980eecf		The woman turns her bow and arrow away from you, continuing to scan the surroundings.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	135	"[what]"
PleadCase_19878566	aki	Everything about this spells out a trap. I need to get out of here.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	139	aki "[what]"
PleadCase_270ae73f		She turns her dark gaze back to you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	143	"[what]"
PleadCase_bae2fd24	aki	Name's Akari. We have a common enemy. I will let you go, for now. Help me, and I will help you in turn.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	145	aki "[what]"
PleadCase_535b3b30	aki	But do not forget, you are still a monster. Try anything funny with me, and I will not hesitate to kill you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	154	aki "[what]"
PleadCase_e427a9ce		Akari backs into the foliage, disappearing in the blink of an eye. You notice how tense you feel, and allow yourself a moment to recover. A chill breeze ruffles your clothes.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	158	"[what]"
PleadCase_f87118bf		The tranquil moment doesn't last for long. You hear the approach of powerful footsteps, and you know you're in for it now.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	160	"[what]"
CallOut_12105838		You desperately call out for Ashina and the hooded woman jumps slightly. She looks at you with a confused expression and lowers her bow.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	167	"[what]"
CallOut_d9e033f3	aki	Who are you yelling for? You should be the only one here.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	173	aki "[what]"
CallOut_d28438a6		The woman looks around, but there’s no sign of Ashina yet. The stranger’s dark gaze briefly returns to you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	177	"[what]"
CallOut_f64bc312	aki	You do look… different than I expected. Name’s Akari. How about you tell me-	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	183	aki "[what]"
CallOut_6d85a4cf		There’s a sudden burst of movement and a fierce growling quickly approaching from behind you. Akari’s eyes go wide, and she quickly backs into the foliage, disappearing in the blink of an eye.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	197	"[what]"
CallOut_89d2d591		The same beastly wolf that attacked you in the alley lunges forward at the treeline, then stops short, giving up the chase.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	204	"[what]"
CallOut_09ef01c9		You watch as, before your eyes, the wolf begins to change. You hear the sharp cracking of bone and the mushy contorting of flesh. You want to look away, but you can’t. Soon enough, Ashina stands before you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	211	"[what]"
BotchedConverge1_66733df5	ash	I seem to recall telling you to stay inside, did I not, pup?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	221	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge1_09c9e739		You turn to face Ashina as she steps closer, looming over you. You reflexively swallow.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	225	"[what]"
BotchedConverge1_130cb3a5	you	You… did.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	227	you "[what]"
BotchedConverge1_40df9e2d	ash	Did you really think I would let you just walk out of here? You silly, naive little thing. You must take me for a fool.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	231	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge1_fcd2191e	ash	This was a test, and you, my dear, have failed. I can see you are not yet ready for the privilege of independence.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	235	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge1_05ab8f60	ash	Tell me, do you take joy in disrespecting me? In betraying the first ounce of trust I place in you?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	241	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge1_8821a2ce	ash	I will not tolerate your behavior. Get back inside. Now.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	246	ash "[what]"
ResistAshina_766b220d	you	This isn’t about you! I wasn't doing anything wrong!	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	259	you "[what]"
ResistAshina_d858f67a	you	You think you can just turn me into some monster, ruin my life and act like I'm supposed to be grateful towards you? No! I've had enough!	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	261	you "[what]"
ResistAshina_7b3a7ccb		You turn away from Ashina and intend to put some space between you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	263	"[what]"
ResistAshina_7f62f629	ash	You will not walk away from me!	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	270	ash "[what]"
ResistAshina_bf5303e7		Ashina grabs your wrist and drags you struggling across the yard. As she does so, you notice a pair of dark eyes watching from the treeline.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	279	"[what]"
ResistAshina_c82fce25		Ashina tosses you into the cabin, slams the front door shut, and snarls at you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	293	"[what]"
ResistAshina_160e0f27	ash	I've given you a chance at a new life! And this is the thanks I get?!	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	295	ash "[what]"
GoWillingly_3dd05a3f		You avert your eyes from Ashina’s intense gaze, and walk back to the cabin. You hear Ashina’s footsteps behind you. Once inside, she approaches you with a fierce expression.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	300	"[what]"
GoWillingly_b1d0cd52		You stumble as your foot catches the edge of the walkway, causing you to topple over. Ashina regards you hesitantly.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	318	"[what]"
GoWillingly_0d977451	ash	I told you to stay inside. Why couldn’t you just listen to me?	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	320	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge2_fb2e9507		Ashina starts pacing as you look up at her from the ground, stunned. After a few moments, she stops and looks down at you with a softer expression.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	333	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_6495213f	ash	Forgive me. You have been… mostly cooperative, I must admit, and you do not deserve my harshness. I understand that you would feel defensive, with how I approached you.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	338	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge2_97b721e4		She offers you a hand, and you hesitantly take it. She helps you up. You feel like a feather in her strong grasp, lifted with ease.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	342	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_5e0233fc	ash	Perhaps you were feeling cooped up, and wanted to explore. I can’t blame you for that. However, you must restrain yourself.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	347	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge2_03cb0050		Her grip on your hand lingers a moment longer, squeezing before pulling away.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	351	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_e87c3392	ash	Trust takes time. You will be allowed to roam soon enough, I promise. Now… Please, return to your room.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	356	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge2_d7b8bfc9		You feel her gaze on your back as you cross the hearth and head upstairs.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	364	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_1391f8d3		When you find yourself lying in bed, you’re cradling your hand over your chest. You can still feel the warmth from when Ashina held it.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	370	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_297a38ab		Ashina raises a hand as if she might hit you, and you reflexively flinch. She stops, a clear hesitation in her eyes.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	383	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_f892531d	ash	...Go to your room.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	388	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge2_f6ccf641		She looks away. You figure you shouldn’t give her time to rethink that decision, and hurry up the stairs.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	396	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_343d0ab7		When you find yourself lying in bed, you struggle to drift off, haunted by memories and the look of concern on your captor’s face.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	402	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_99f65fc2	ash	You reckless, ungrateful fool. Clearly you do not understand your situation, despite me going to great lengths to explain it.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	416	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge2_f01fec20		She grabs the back of your shirt, dragging you towards the staircase.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	421	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_373da312	ash	It seems I am going to need to teach you a hard lesson, girl. Perhaps then you will realize the wisdom in my words.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	423	ash "[what]"
BotchedConverge2_1a6d1172		You claw at her leg, her wrist, but she ignores it, dragging you painfully up the stairs. You manage to tug your shirt out of her grip, but she grabs and painfully twists your arm.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	427	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_8b918a24		She forces you across the hall, and then throws you into your room. The door slams as you scramble towards it, your monstrous hands clawing at the wood. There’s a distinct sound of the door being locked.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	429	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_d6b8b7a8		You turn and make for the window, but when you’re within steps of it, the dogs outside erupt into growls and barks. Even if you climbed out, they would rip you to shreds.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	431	"[what]"
BotchedConverge2_3586dcc6		You collapse onto the ground and sob.	game/story/botched_escape_scene.rpy	433	"[what]"
DreamScene_97b3d4f1		Your consciousness bubbles to the surface as sunlight heats your skin nearly to the point of burning. You squint down at your tiny hands, wet with tears.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	16	"[what]"
DreamScene_fdb43914	you	This dream again… Why? Why now?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	18	you "[what]"
DreamScene_15c6133f		You cry uncontrollably, standing alone on your front porch. Your heart aches with betrayal and confusion.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	20	"[what]"
DreamScene_28e48c78	you	For the life of me, I couldn't tell you what I did to make them so upset. It was always something with them, no matter how good I tried to be.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	22	you "[what]"
DreamScene_33d693e0		A shadow crosses into your field of vision. You look up through bleary eyes to see your neighbor, crouched down with one hand extended towards you, palm side up.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	31	"[what]"
DreamScene_c1da7b60	neighbor	Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing out here all by yourself? Are your folks not home?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	33	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_8d5f1ec9		You struggle to speak through rising sobs, but somehow manage to croak out a response.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	35	"[what]"
DreamScene_925cf46e	you	No… Mommy and Daddy just don't like me right now. They said I gotta stay out here until I learn my lesson…	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	37	you "[what]"
DreamScene_cb95bcff		Your neighbor frowns and looks deep in thought, before turning back to you with as much of a smile as she can muster.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	39	"[what]"
DreamScene_d1f29f75	neighbor	Alright, how about we hang out at my house for today? Does that sound good, honey? I'll let your folks know where you are. My wife's making cookies!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	41	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_82d915d2		Your neighbor smiles encouragingly. Your sobs momentarily stop at the mention of sweet treats. You look up at them hopefully.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	43	"[what]"
DreamScene_8306df5b	you	Cookies…? Will there be chocolate chip?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	45	you "[what]"
DreamScene_7fc27713		Your neighbor chuckles.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	47	"[what]"
DreamScene_6b148ad3	neighbor	Any flavor you want. Come along now. Hold my hand when we cross the street, okay?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	49	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_5c868d62		You do as you're told, suddenly feeling in higher spirits, as your neighbor continues making delightful promises.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	51	"[what]"
DreamScene_21ca2197	neighbor	We have the biggest collection of movies at home! You can pick your favorite!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	53	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_831ece01		That day was special. For the first time in your life, you felt like you had an adult you could trust. Your neighbor's place was somewhere you could go on the days when “home” felt more like a warzone.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	58	"[what]"
DreamScene_13b1e06e		But, of course, good things don't last forever.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	60	"[what]"
DreamScene_dfa1857a	you	But, why?! I still don't get it! Why do you have to move? Why can't you just stay here?! Did I do something wrong?!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	68	you "[what]"
DreamScene_84fed097		You bawl your eyes out just inside your neighbor’s front door. You're surrounded by boxes, a big moving truck parked in the driveway behind you. Your neighbor looks at you with sad eyes.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	70	"[what]"
DreamScene_b3653db4	neighbor	We aren’t moving because of you. Please don't think that.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	72	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_e16db0d4		They look away, speaking to you in a gentle, cautious tone.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	74	"[what]"
DreamScene_987e2b08	neighbor	It's just… We're starting a family now. This house won't be big enough for the new baby.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	76	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_78105b54	you	Then take me with you!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	78	you "[what]"
DreamScene_c95d493d	neighbor	We'd love to have you there, we really would.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	80	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_d03128b7	neighbor	But, we can't just take you from your parents. They're your family.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	82	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_51ea51cd	you	No, they're not! You're my family!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	84	you "[what]"
DreamScene_aefa506f		Your neighbor gives you an empathetic smile as you sink down to the ground, crying.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	86	"[what]"
DreamScene_f23d9fc4	neighbor	Listen, sweetheart. How about we leave you our phone number? When we're all settled in, maybe your parents can bring you to visit us.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	88	neighbor "[what]"
DreamScene_bbc2762b		Your blood boils and your emotions flood out all at once as you rise to your feet, wiping your tears with your arm.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	90	"[what]"
DreamScene_aa27aa11	you	Why did you have to have that stupid baby?!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	92	you "[what]"
DreamScene_c8df1c63	you	I hate you! I hate your wife, and I hate hate hate your baby! I never want to see you again!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	94	you "[what]"
DreamScene_42d9d77d		You run out of the house, never stopping to look back.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	99	"[what]"
DreamScene_96420231		That was the last thing you ever said to them.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	101	"[what]"
DreamScene_08174e2a		You've always wished you could go back, to tell them what they meant to you. To thank them for what they did for you, for being a safe harbor in the never-ending storm of your life. But, life doesn't give second chances.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	103	"[what]"
DreamScene_d6a500df		Soon, the scene is washed away, and the play begins anew. You're in a classroom and the teacher is giving yet another droning lesson. You're older now, just having started 9th grade.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	105	"[what]"
DreamScene_3e13f54f		The lunch bell rings, jolting you out of your seat.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	107	"[what]"
DreamScene_de982fb2	teacher	Alright, class! That concludes the lesson for today. Remember that your reports are due this Friday!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	115	teacher "[what]"
DreamScene_ba92d9ea		As you're about to walk through the door, the teacher points at you with a stern face.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	117	"[what]"
DreamScene_5dfd8901	teacher	You there. Stay behind, I need to speak with you privately.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	119	teacher "[what]"
DreamScene_70bf45e1		Nerves flutter in your stomach. You slowly walk over to their desk as the rest of the students filter out of the room. Great, what did you mess up this time?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	121	"[what]"
DreamScene_03e7c95b	teacher	I’ve noticed you haven’t been eating lunch in a while. I checked with the lunch staff, and they said your account hasn’t had new funds added to it in weeks.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	123	teacher "[what]"
DreamScene_4871e5e1		You frown, a defensive burning rising within your chest. That's not anyone else's business, why are they bringing it up?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	125	"[what]"
DreamScene_1a1826d1	you	And?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	127	you "[what]"
DreamScene_618e34bd	teacher	…Is everything alright at home? Should we sign you up for free lunches? What’s going on?	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	129	teacher "[what]"
DreamScene_a3b7d5df		You shrug noncommittally.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	131	"[what]"
DreamScene_0288cec5	you	Guess I’m just not that hungry.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	133	you "[what]"
DreamScene_070e38ea		The teacher sighs.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	135	"[what]"
DreamScene_1e876651	teacher	Should I contact your parents, then? They should be getting emails that your account is empty, but maybe they need to update their contact information.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	137	teacher "[what]"
DreamScene_c234d17d	you	No!	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	139	you "[what]"
DreamScene_8dddb792		You blurt the word out without thinking, then look away.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	141	"[what]"
DreamScene_c515b63a	you	…Look, I just don’t like asking them, okay? Trust me, it’s easier that way. Not like losing a few pounds would kill me, either.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	143	you "[what]"
DreamScene_516b6030		Whoops. You know that concerned look. You shouldn’t have said anything.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	145	"[what]"
DreamScene_428abde2	teacher	Well… You know, my partner always packs me way too much food for lunch, I can never eat it all.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	147	teacher "[what]"
DreamScene_b99a2599		You give them a confused look as they set a lunchbox on the table.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	149	"[what]"
DreamScene_19d5497d	teacher	So, help me out with it? They always look so sad when I get home and haven’t eaten it all, so really, you’d be doing me a big favor.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	151	teacher "[what]"
DreamScene_4f029247		They open the lunchbox, and sure enough, it is packed to the brim. Maybe they’re actually telling the truth.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	153	"[what]"

DreamScene_c673f839		In the end, they all abandoned you. None of them were strong or kind enough to step out of their own damn comfort zones.

DreamScene_d41b8517		It fills you with rage. Rage at every not-so-innocent bystander with their plastered smiles, shielding themselves from the horrors of the world. It’s because of them you refuse to close your eyes to suffering. You’ll never be like them.	game/story/dream_scene.rpy	198	"[what]"

FailedRescueScene_e1f676e8	cam	I didn’t even think, I just started following, but I couldn’t get close because there were a bunch of dogs around, and they didn’t look friendly. I followed you all the way to this cabin.	game/story/failed_rescue_scene.rpy	125	cam "[what]"

FailedRescueScene_378ac115	cam	I thought about going to the police, but no way they’d believe me. I went to work and tried to forget about it, but I couldn’t. So, here I am.	game/story/failed_rescue_scene.rpy	169	cam "[what]"

FailedRescueScene_f4109ab3	cam	But, I dunno, I couldn’t leave without trying. So, come on, let’s go home and I’ll make you a nice, hot bowl of pozole. 	game/story/failed_rescue_scene.rpy	222	cam "[what]"
FailedRescueScene_1e31aaae		A shiver goes down your spine, and your breathing sounds... different.

GoWithCam_7a4f2871		You try to ignore that, in the back of your head, you hunger more for the plate of raw meat from earlier than a bowl of soup. You’d give anything to feel normal. Your tiny, dingy apartment doesn’t sound so bad right now.	game/story/failed_rescue_scene.rpy	238	"[what]"

ICanSeeTheStarsScene_4e09d8f0	you	I need to tell you something. Someone is after you. The other night-	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	174	you "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_a088f268	ash	What, that little miscreant in the woods? I’ve been giving her the run around for years, don’t you fret your little head about it.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	178	ash "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_8ff19bbc		Ashina waves a hand dismissively, but you catch her arm and look at her meaningfully. It gives her pause enough for you to carry on.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	182	"[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_c322dfc8	you	The other night, when… I went outside against your wishes…	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	184	you "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_1bd0a630	you	I met a huntress armed with a bow and arrow, who I now know is named Akari. She shot a note up to my window earlier tonight, asking to meet in two days’ time, and told me she intends to kill you, Ashina. Soon.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	188	you "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_08a1db04	ash	Hm, I'd like to see her try. She's delusional if she thinks she can take me down. I will devise a way to deal with her, don’t you worry. I have no need- hm.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	192	ash "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_ae21241c		Ashina pauses, as if reconsidering her words. The arrogant atmosphere around her melts away, and she visibly softens. She takes a breath before meeting your gaze.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	194	"[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_044297f6	ash	Forgive me. I… appreciate you telling me this. I am glad I arrived that night before the huntress could do you any harm. My heart could not bear to lose yet another… of my kin.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	198	ash "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_619e57ff		You weren't prepared for Ashina to be so…caring towards you. You feel heat rise to your cheeks and instinctively look away before speaking again.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	200	"[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_cc73bc32	you	What should I do about the meeting then? Akari will be expecting me.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	202	you "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_c5a92f72	ash	Hm… Meet with her. Best she doesn’t know that anything is amiss. Learn her plan, and then we can prepare accordingly.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	206	ash "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_2469b1c4	ash	You shouldn't be in any danger if she has no reason to believe you'll betray her. However… If something happens, call out to me, and I will come to your aid.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	210	ash "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_189f31b5		Ashina moves closer to you, her hand slowly hooking around your upper arm. There’s a pause, then her head comes to rest on your shoulder, just as cautious as her hand.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	222	"[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_b38741a5		It’s a profound show of intimacy, and it takes you off guard. You can’t help but feel that, at this moment, Ashina seems more like a flighty fawn than the intimidating beast from the alleyway.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	224	"[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_5690a862		You find yourself leaning just slightly into her touch, and you feel the tension in her body begin to ease, little by little.

ICanSeeTheStarsScene_b64e5040	ash	I usually avoid the city, but I found myself wandering the streets more often than I should these past few months.

ICanSeeTheStarsScene_d7c91268	ash	I grew accustomed to our walks. Some nights later, I decided I must have you. I reasoned to myself that it was the perfect opportunity, that it was my duty to continue the Lycan bloodline, but…	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	234	ash "[what]"
ICanSeeTheStarsScene_2d108589	ash	If I am honest, that is only half the truth.	game/story/i_can_see_the_stars_scene.rpy	236	ash "[what]"

ICanSeeTheStarsScene_249886c4	ash	Regardless, I need you to know this: I did not bring you here to suffer.

LettersScene_ac76e2f7		Just as you're about to fall asleep, you hear a sharp whistle, and then the splitting of wood near your window. You crawl out of your bed to investigate.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	11	"[what]"
LettersScene_7ac897b2		The dogs yap and jump up at the window as if something’s there. You open the window and lean out, looking around. To the side of the window, you discover an arrow with a piece of paper bound to its shaft.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	19	"[what]"
LettersScene_9e18be82		Your thoughts immediately turn towards that mysterious hooded woman, with her bow and arrow.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	21	"[what]"
LettersScene_51171a77	you	Could it be…?	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	23	you "[what]"

LettersScene_95a3771e		To my unlikely ally…	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	34	"[what]"
LettersScene_a4f4b81b		Since our first meeting, I found myself intrigued by you. I have been keeping an eye on you from afar. From my understanding, you look to be a prisoner, and I know some of what that monster has subjected you to.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	36	"[what]"
LettersScene_3df22b97		I offer you a way out and a chance at redemption. It is my sole purpose to rid this world of the evil that presides over you.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	38	"[what]"
LettersScene_621356a4		Let us meet in two days' time at the forest’s edge. We shall then devise a plan to kill your dark mistress.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	40	"[what]"
LettersScene_088866c2		In the meantime, you must gather intel for me. Find out any weaknesses your mistress has, and how those dogs outside the cabin can be dealt with. Earn the beast's trust, so that we may exploit it.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	42	"[what]"
LettersScene_f3d74a08		Your behavior the night we met was less than satisfactory. I hope for your sake it was a ruse, or a moment of weakness. Make no mistake: Your captor is a murderer, and she will make one of you as well.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	45	"[what]"
LettersScene_d79cd579		This is your one, and only, chance. Prove your allegiance to humanity, or share your mistress’s fate.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	47	"[what]"
LettersScene_02480266		I have seen, in your eyes, your struggle with the beast within you. Find it a warning or a comfort that if you do not keep it in check, I will not hesitate to do what must be done.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	50	"[what]"
LettersScene_015c9042		Good luck. I will continue to watch over you until the time comes.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	52	"[what]"

LettersScene_d629c2b1		Heavy footfalls interrupt your thoughts. You quickly hide the letter and arrow under your bed.	game/story/letters_scene.rpy	62	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_447e4054		You are woken up by a loud rapping at the door.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	12	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_131fb085	ash	Did you have a restful slumber?	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	25	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_79c566f9		Ashina stands tall above your bed. There's a kindness in her eyes, which fades away quickly when she realizes you're staring.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	35	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_bfc61fd8	ash	Don't get the wrong idea, pet. I haven't forgotten about your little escapade last night.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	37	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_f313e09f		She walks back out into the hall, gesturing for you to follow. You rise from the bed, and do so.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	41	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_0447a487	ash	But, it got me thinking. Perhaps it wasn’t that you were recklessly thinking of introducing lycanthropy to the masses. Perhaps you had a more altruistic motive.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	57	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_8f92ca11		Once you read the bottom of the stairs and step into the hearth, Ashina turns and steps close to you. Her eyes burn into you with a lingering question.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	74	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_229b8d52	ash	Not that you would have gotten very far before I caught you, but you get my point.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	80	ash "[what]"

SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_efd0a23a	ash	You have been quite obedient. It seems like you have a good head on those pretty little shoulders, as you clearly grasp the reality of your situation.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	114	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_99158c27	ash	I appreciate that. I am not unreasonable, and I feel you’ve earned a reward. So, let's make a deal.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	120	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_2b8d2695		She speaks with such arrogance that one could easily miss the vulnerable glint in her eyes, and the slight shift in her posture. You briefly wonder how she might look without that carefully crafted mask of hers.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	126	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_21dd91c6	ash	I'll agree to let your friend go, and they will be free to return to their normal life.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	132	ash "[what]"

SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_07a38f0a	ash	Very clever of you, pet. But, it is just one simple condition.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	142	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_71de20d4	ash	Your friend may never speak of us Lycans once they leave here. Not to the authorities. Not to their family. Not to anyone. I- we- will lose everything if that happens.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	148	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_ac34d1f0		There’s a haunted look in her eyes. A memory tugs at the edge of your consciousness. Crackling fire and mournful howls. Bottomless agony, threatening to pull you under.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	154	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_a6d82e9e	ash	They'll burn everything to the ground. The cabin. The dogs. You, over my dead body.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	156	ash "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_3b22f798		Just like that, the feelings fade, leaving you a bit disoriented.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	161	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_ce8bcd1d	ash	This is my home. The land of my people. All that I have left of them… Do you understand?	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	167	ash "[what]"

SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_eb5afd39	ash	Now, go to them. Descend from the hearth, and you shall find them in the basement. I will be waiting at the top of the stairs.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	193	ash "[what]"

SpeakNoEvilSceneP1_a3bc6e04	you	That's easy for her to say… She doesn't know how stubborn Cameron can be.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p1.rpy	211	you "[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP2_9f8667f8		You reach the basement and are hit with an earthy chill. You unlock the door with the key Ashina gave you, and step inside.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p2.rpy	5	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP2_0bc9def9		You find Cameron huddled in a corner of the room. They shift, acknowledging your presence, but don’t turn around.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p2.rpy	14	"[what]"

SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_7106f88a		Your legs trudge forward as you make your way to your room without replying. You can't even stand to look at Ashina right now. You don't want to do this. You can't leave Cameron behind.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	67	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_a925ab7b		But, there's no choice. If Ashina wants them dead, Cameron's fate is sealed. There's nothing you can do. You never have control over anything you care about.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	69	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_3605ca36		You stumble your way into your room. You autopilot yourself into bed. Maybe if you go to sleep now, you can convince yourself that tonight was just a bad nightmare.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	71	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_b4597d48		Yes, when you wake up, Cameron will still be alive. You tell yourself, maybe they can come to an understanding with Ashina. Everything will be ok. Everything will—	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	73	"[what]"

SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_34e22136		You hear every bit of terror in their labored breathing. You smell their fresh blood rushing from their arteries. You can practically feel it as Ashina slams their limp body into the basement wall.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	83	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_1ed35de0	ash	I'm trying to make this easy on you, human! Stay still!	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	85	ash "[what]"

SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_883df2c3		You hear an awful sound. The crunching of their bones, the splitting of their tendons, the twisting of their flesh. The sound of Cameron's heartbeat slows, and soon it beats for the very last time.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	89	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_f515613f		...You should have tried harder. To convince Cameron to leave. To escape this prison together. To have a strong enough will to live to not even end up in this fucked up situation to begin with.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	91	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_6055e3ee		Your inability to find control over your own life has gotten your best friend killed. Even though Ashina dealt the killing blow, you can't help but feel like this is entirely your fault.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	93	"[what]"
SpeakNoEvilSceneP3_d62b650d		You don't know if you can live with yourself after this.	game/story/speak_no_evil_scene_p3.rpy	95	"[what]"

WakingScene_e9289a2a		A stinging sensation fills your body as you attempt to sit up. Your fingers touch the tender wound on your shoulder, the bite from that…thing, yesterday. You hesitate to call it a wolf.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	17	"[what]"
WakingScene_5be9e161		You take a glance at your immediate surroundings. The room is mostly bare. Some fake-looking flowers decorate the minimal furnishings.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	23	"[what]"
WakingScene_b23ee1fd		Flirting with disaster finally caught up with you. What the hell were you thinking? You vow that if you ever escape this place, you're going to have a serious think about your life choices.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	28	"[what]"
WakingScene_94e17376		It’s a dark, bitter thought, but you can’t help it. There’s a reason you were outside that night, and now you’ve gotten what you wanted, right?	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	31	"[what]"
WakingScene_1fad1f6b		You’re shaken from your thoughts by the sound of a door opening. A tall, muscular woman with tan skin enters the room.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	32	"[what]"
WakingScene_155535f1	ash	I see you're finally awake. Tell me, how was your slumber?	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	37	ash "[what]"

WakingScene_38323d3c	ash	Now, sit up properly. I've prepared a meal for you.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	64	ash "[what]"
WakingScene_01d96107		Your stomach grumbles at the mere mention of food. You don't know what you're doing here, much less who this woman is, but you need something in your stomach now.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	68	"[what]"
WakingScene_8bbcac7f		You sit up. The woman reaches into the hallway, then sets a plate on the side table next to the bed.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	69	"[what]"
WakingScene_cdb26de4	ash	Here. Eat to your heart's content.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	71	ash "[what]"
WakingScene_5f78a77c		On the plate is a pile of raw meat. Blood pools at the bottom of the chunks, and the stench of death reeks in the air.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	78	"[what]"
WakingScene_44afb029	you	You can't be serious…There's no way I can eat that!	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	79	you "[what]"
WakingScene_124948e0	ash	Are you really so sure? Doesn't your hunger just feel...	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	80	ash "[what]"
WakingScene_fa808e18	ash	Unbearable?	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	91	ash "[what]"
WakingScene_895605e3		You take another look at the plate. You hate to admit it, but your stomach betrays you. You don't just want to eat it...	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	92	"[what]"
WakingScene_164bd59a	ash	Ah, so you finally understand the gravity of the situation.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	116	ash "[what]"

WakingScene_869f5c7b		The meat is… surprisingly palatable. It has a deep, tender richness. You barely restrain yourself from stuffing your face ravenously. The clawing hunger soon subsides.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	129	"[what]"
WakingScene_005388cf		You realize the woman has been watching you.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	130	"[what]"

WakingScene_83d00a15	ash	You will need to eat eventually, girl, but I suppose I can allow you some time to adjust. Now, get some rest.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	141	ash "[what]"
WakingScene_cd604703		Seemingly satisfied with the interaction, Ashina exits the room. You notice that despite a full day’s rest, you’re struggling to keep your eyes open.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	149	"[what]"
WakingScene_3006481d		You force your eyes to focus. On the far wall, there is a window. A possible escape route?	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	154	"[what]"
ExamineWindow_6f164308		You approach the window, and a low rumbling shakes the floor.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	177	"[what]"

ExamineWindow_c15908eb		A strange sensation rises within you. You feel... a connection. No, a web of connections. Recognition. You are a sheep to be herded. A pup to be corrected.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	210	"[what]"
ExamineWindow_3b243bce		You push away the sensation, quickly shut the window, and decide you'll deal with that later.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	214	"[what]"

ExamineWindow_db2cd75f		You walk back to the bedside table and retrieve the plate of raw meat, before heaving the plate to toss the meat out the window.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	221	"[what]"
ExamineWindow_f9fec881		The dogs rush towards the meat, tails wagging. You don’t know why, but you smile.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	223	"[what]"
HeadtoBed_b9c583e8		A wave of exhaustion nearly buckles your knees. You stumble back towards the bed, barely feeling the soft caress of the pillow before everything goes dark.	game/story/waking_scene.rpy	233	"[what]"

WhoYouAreScene_a27eff64		Hunger, and a buzzing energy in your skin, making you acutely aware of every movement and the sensation of the sheets around you. You know somebody is standing outside of the door to your room.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	15	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_0bcc6c0e		You sit up, and sure enough, the door opens and the woman steps in.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	20	"[what]"

WhoYouAreScene_7811bcb4		The woman leads you out of your room, down the stairs, and into a spacious hearth. The area is well adorned, equipped with ornate furnishings and a large fireplace to keep the place warm, and to cook with you suppose. Not that she used it.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	67	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_3d62c4fc		The woman stops and languidly gestures forward. You’re distracted by the muscles in her arm, the sight vivid and detailed in a way that’s unsettling. A loveseat made of furs and hides lies before you.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	75	"[what]"

WhoYouAreScene_fdec97da		You sit. She glides toward the seat opposite you. A spread of elegantly plated slices of raw meat sits between the two of you. You could've mistaken it for a charcuterie board, if you didn’t know better.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	116	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_fc7d7204		The woman reaches forward and delicately plucks a slice of raw meat, before lowering it to her lips. She chews it as if it were soft as butter, her eyes burning into you with an intensity.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	118	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_7ee405ec		You avert your gaze to the raw meat on the table, and feel your mouth start to drool. Your pulse races as the bloody scent overpowers you. Your skin itches with a widespread pin-pricking sensation.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	137	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_c4697797	you	What did you do to me…? I don't feel normal. Every little thing feels…	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	149	you "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_9cf9490c		Ashina’s voice sounds distant and muffled.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	158	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_2df5ba10	ash	Overwhelming? Powerful? Perhaps even…Feral?	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	160	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_b3acf198	you	Yes… And more. Make… Make it stop.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	170	you "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_dc15913c	ash	I figured as much.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	172	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_9b0ac127		You hear a distant sigh, and some movement. It’s hard to concentrate on anything but the-	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	174	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_b71b9504	ash	Take a deep breath and look at me.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	176	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_8ddf5a01		You do so, and feel the sensations begin to subside. You feel as if you could get lost in her eyes, tumbling down into their depths, if you wanted to. You don’t. You definitely don’t.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	203	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_e31a2d5e		Your captor stretches her arms out to her sides in a dramatic gesture.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	205	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_d2de3932	ash	Now, pay attention. I am going to explain how your life will be from now on, girl.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	207	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_d258f3c7	ash	That is- What you have become, what you must do to survive, and why you can never return to your old life.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	209	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_46dd34db	ash	I am, and you are, lykánthrōpos, lycanthrope, or in layman's terms, werewolf. Descendants of witches, able to infect others with our so-called curse.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	214	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_2d3616a6	ash	There are many historical accounts of our supposed origins, most claiming that our distant ancestors became as we are through acts of heinous depravity, usually related to the consumption of human flesh.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	216	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_38879dc8	ash	I have plenty of notes and readings on the subject that you will eventually be given access to, should you behave. Moving on.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	218	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_674afc63		The woman stands, walking around you as she speaks.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	228	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_dcdb90fd	ash	We have heightened strength, senses, and connection with one another and canines. As the full moon approaches, we become closer to our beast, our wolf, and can change our skin with more ease.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	241	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_ab4e74d0		Her hand runs along the back of your seat, nearly brushing your skin. It sends a shiver down your spine.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	246	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_20b3ae87	ash	You will need to be trained to handle your beast, lest you be driven mad with hunger and rage. And trust me, pup, you do not want that to happen.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	248	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_0fc28b8f		She gives you a very serious, knowing look. Then, her features contort as you’ve seen once before.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	264	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_81fdef8d	ash	We are carnivores. We crave raw meat like nothing else. Our emotions, like our senses, are heightened and must be kept in check.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	271	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_bf517e51		Her voice becomes more like a growl as she advances on you. You feel your breath catch in your throat.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	284	"[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_751854a0	ash	And this is why we cannot be around people. The sight of us losing control for even a moment, or worse, the mistakes we make under the wolf’s influence, will be punished with death or torture.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	286	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_c67cf65f	ash	There is ugliness in what we are, but there is beauty, too. You will know it when you feel the wind flowing through your fur, and find you are a part of something so much greater than yourself.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	292	ash "[what]"
WhoYouAreScene_7ed47cda		She looks at you expectantly as she looms over you, and you realize she’s waiting for a response.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	298	"[what]"

AppreciationResponse_fc98ce2e	you	You know, if I’m honest… I’ve always wanted to be part of something bigger than myself. For a long time I’ve felt… lost, I guess.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	314	you "[what]"
AppreciationResponse_a233c526	you	I thought I knew what I wanted, but everything just ended up being so… hard. Weirdly, I feel more in control now than I have in a while.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	316	you "[what]"
AppreciationResponse_48daacb8		Ashina’s gaze softens.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	321	"[what]"
AppreciationResponse_5ab5731d	ash	The world can be cruel. No matter how clear your vision for the future, reality wears you down over time.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	323	ash "[what]"
AppreciationResponse_183707ee	ash	There used to be more of us, you know. Now I fear we may be the last. I, too, once had dreams. Those dreams died with my kin.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	328	ash "[what]"
AppreciationResponse_10756823	ash	But there is a strength that comes with acceptance. Change what you can, and accept what you cannot, I believe the saying goes.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	333	ash "[what]"
AppreciationResponse_3a995c2e	ash	Still… that doesn’t mean you cannot feel angry about it. The anger pushes us forward. That is its own kind of strength.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	335	ash "[what]"
AppreciationResponse_b90aaaea		Ashina goes quiet, staring into the embers of the fireplace. For a moment, you feel an intense sorrow that ebbs and flows into a calm. You’re not sure how long the two of you sit there in reflective silence, but eventually, she rises.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	339	"[what]"
AppreciationResponse_a4c09435	ash	I shall retire to my room. You may move about the cabin as you wish, but do stay inside.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	341	ash "[what]"
AppreciationResponse_1d2df939		With that, she leaves, taking the calm with her.	game/story/who_you_are_scene.rpy	346	"[what]"
