        "Your consciousness bubbles to the surface as sunlight heats your skin nearly to the point of burning. You squint down at your tiny hands, wet with tears."

        you "{i}This dream again… Why? Why now?{/i}"

        "You cry uncontrollably, standing alone on your front porch. Your heart aches with betrayal and confusion."

        you "{i}For the life of me, I couldn't tell you what I did to make them so upset. It was always something with them, no matter how good I tried to be.{/i}"

        "A shadow crosses into your field of vision. You look up through bleary eyes to see your neighbor, crouched down with one hand extended towards you, palm side up."

        neighbor "Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing out here all by yourself? Are your folks not home?"

        "You struggle to speak through rising sobs, but somehow manage to croak out a response."

        you "No… Mommy and Daddy just don't like me right now. They said I gotta stay out here until I learn my lesson…"

        "Your neighbor frowns and looks deep in thought, before turning back to you with as much of a smile as she can muster."

        neighbor "Alright, how about we hang out at my house for today? Does that sound good, honey? I'll let your folks know where you are. My wife's making cookies!"

        "Your neighbor smiles encouragingly. Your sobs momentarily stop at the mention of sweet treats. You look up at them hopefully."

        you "Cookies…? Will there be chocolate chip?"

        "Your neighbor chuckles."

        neighbor "Any flavor you want. Come along now. Hold my hand when we cross the street, okay?"

        "You do as you're told, suddenly feeling in higher spirits, as your neighbor continues making delightful promises."

        neighbor "We have the biggest collection of movies at home! You can pick your favorite!"

        "That day was special. For the first time in your life, you felt like you had an adult you could trust. Your neighbor's place was somewhere you could go on the days when “home” felt more like a warzone."

        "But, of course, good things don't last forever."

        you "But, why?! I still don't get it! Why do you have to move? Why can't you just stay here?! Did I do something wrong?!"

        "You bawl your eyes out just inside your neighbor’s front door. You're surrounded by boxes, a big moving truck parked in the driveway behind you. Your neighbor looks at you with sad eyes."

        neighbor "We aren’t moving because of you. Please don't think that." 

        "They look away, speaking to you in a gentle, cautious tone."

        neighbor "It's just… We're starting a family now. This house won't be big enough for the new baby." 

        you "Then take me with you!"

        neighbor "We'd love to have you there, we really would."

        neighbor "But, we can't just take you from your parents. They're your family." 

        you "No, they're not! {i}You're{/i} my family!" 

        "Your neighbor gives you an empathetic smile as you sink down to the ground, crying." 

        neighbor "Listen, sweetheart. How about we leave you our phone number? When we're all settled in, maybe your parents can bring you to visit us."

        "Your blood boils and your emotions flood out all at once as you rise to your feet, wiping your tears with your arm."

        you "Why did you have to have that stupid baby?!"

        you "I {color=#ff0000}{b}hate{/color}{/b} you! I {color=#ff0000}{b}hate{/color}{/b} your wife, and I {color=#ff0000}{b}hate hate {i}hate{/i}{/color}{/b} your baby! I never want to see you again!"

        "You run out of the house, never stopping to look back." 

        "That was the last thing you ever said to them."

        "You've always wished you could go back, to tell them what they meant to you. To thank them for what they did for you, for being a safe harbor in the never-ending storm of your life. But, life doesn't give second chances."

        "Soon, the scene is washed away, and the play begins anew. You're in a classroom and the teacher is giving yet another droning lesson. You're older now, just having started 9th grade."

        "The lunch bell rings, jolting you out of your seat."

        teacher "Alright, class! That concludes the lesson for today. Remember that your reports are due this Friday!"

        "As you're about to walk through the door, the teacher points at you with a stern face."

        teacher "You there. Stay behind, I need to speak with you privately."

        "Nerves flutter in your stomach. You slowly walk over to their desk as the rest of the students filter out of the room. Great, what did you mess up this time?"

        teacher "I’ve noticed you haven’t been eating lunch in a while. I checked with the lunch staff, and they said your account hasn’t had new funds added to it in weeks."

        "You frown, a defensive burning rising within your chest. That's not anyone else's business, why are they bringing it up?"

        you "And?"

        teacher "…Is everything alright at home? Should we sign you up for free lunches? What’s going on?"

        "You shrug noncommittally."

        you "Guess I’m just not that hungry."

        "The teacher sighs."

        teacher "Should I contact your parents, then? They should be getting emails that your account is empty, but maybe they need to update their contact information."

        you "No!"

        "You blurt the word out without thinking, then look away."

        you "…Look, I just don’t like asking them, okay? Trust me, it’s easier that way. Not like losing a few pounds would kill me, either."

        "Whoops. You know that concerned look. You shouldn’t have said anything."

        teacher "Well… You know, my partner always packs me {i}way{/i} too much food for lunch, I can never eat it all."

        "You give them a confused look as they set a lunchbox on the table."

        teacher "So, help me out with it? They always look so sad when I get home and haven’t eaten it all, so really, you’d be doing me a big favor."

        "They open the lunchbox, and sure enough, it {i}is{/i} packed to the brim. Maybe they’re actually telling the truth."

        "Or maybe you’re just hungry. You feel your stomach gurgle."

        you "…I guess I could eat, if it helps."

        "Your teacher gives you a big smile."

        "From then on, that was your lunch routine. Your teacher never asked any too-hard questions, and you two would just chat about the simple things." 

        "Sometimes, you wished they would ask. Sometimes, you wished they would do something about it."

        "It wasn’t a big explosion like with your neighbor. That almost stings more. One day, you walked into class, and there was a substitute. And the next day, and the next day, until you found out that your teacher had been fired."

        "Lots of nasty rumors spread in speculation of their sudden discharge. You heard things that made you sick to your stomach. You want to believe in the kind teacher that tricked you into eating lunch, but doubts about their true nature haunt you to this day."

        "More scenes play out, smaller moments of hope and reprieve, the end always the same. People passing through your life like ships in the night, as they say. Teaching you a lesson."
